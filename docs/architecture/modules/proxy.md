# module: internal/proxy

The data plane: a localhost reverse proxy for `<METHOD> /<upstream>/<rest...>`. It halts when
the vault is locked (503), authenticates the calling agent's bearer token (401), resolves the
upstream by name (404), then evaluates the policy engine on the upstream-relative path
(`/<rest>`):

- `deny` → 403 `access denied`.
- `require-approval` → blocks on `approval.Submit`; approved ⇒ continue, denied/timeout ⇒ 403, ctx-canceled ⇒ 504.
- `allow` → continue.

If the matched rule sets a rate limit, the in-memory `policy.Limiter` is consulted (keyed by
`agentID|ruleID`); over the limit ⇒ 429. It then strips the agent's `Authorization`, applies the
upstream authenticator obtained from `authn.Manager` (so OIDC tokens are cached across requests),
and forwards via `httputil.ReverseProxy` (`Host` rewritten to the upstream, query preserved).

**K1 (k8s clusters).** When the resolved target is `Kind=="k8s"`, the proxy parses the request
into the RBAC tuple (`k8s.Parse`) and evaluates `policy.Decide` with `Kind:"k8s"` +
namespace/resource/subresource/verb instead of method+path. Discovery/health paths
(`IsResource==false`, e.g. `/version`, `/api`, `/openapi/...`) are allowed for any agent that
holds ≥1 grant on the cluster (kubectl needs them), else denied. The per-cluster TLS transport
from `authn.Manager.Transport` is attached, and `FlushInterval=-1` is set so `logs -f` / `-w`
stream incrementally. The `approval.Pending` carries the k8s tuple (Namespace/Resource/Verb)
for the UI.

**K2 (mutating verbs gated by approval).** For a k8s mutating verb
(create/update/patch/delete/deletecollection) whose rule resolves to `require-approval`, the
proxy reads the agent's request body once **before** `approval.Submit`, stores a
`audit.BodyCap`-capped copy on `Pending.RequestBody` (the patch = the change the operator
sees), and replaces `r.Body` with a reader over the **full** bytes so the forwarded payload is
never truncated and the audit tee re-reads the same body — the underlying stream is read
exactly once. On approve the request proceeds and the agent gets the real API response; on
deny it returns 403 and the upstream is **not** called. The injected cluster credential is
added later (the `Rewrite` step), so it is never part of the captured/previewed body.

## Audit (optional)

When `Deps.Audit != nil` the handler records each request to the audit journal (see `audit.md`
and ADR-0004). The inbound request body is wrapped with a capped capture before forwarding; the
upstream response body is wrapped in `ModifyResponse`, and the audit row is written from that
capture's `onClose` — after the response has fully streamed to the agent. The entry carries the
agent/upstream id+name, method, upstream-relative path, query, status, duration, req/resp sizes,
the decision + matched rule id, the masked request headers, and both captured bodies. Upstream
transport failures are recorded via the `ErrorHandler` as a `502`. The early policy outcomes are
recorded inline before returning: `deny → 403`, approval-denied `→ 403`, rate-limited `→ 429`. The
pre-policy guards (`401`/`404`/`503`) are not recorded. When `Audit == nil` the proxy behaves
exactly as in Plans 1–3 (no capture, no recording).

## Public API

- `Deps struct { Agents *agent.Registry; Upstreams *upstream.Registry; Policy *policy.Registry; Limiter *policy.Limiter; Approvals *approval.Queue; AuthManager *authn.Manager; Vault *secret.Vault; Audit *audit.Recorder; Logger *slog.Logger }` (`Audit` optional/nil-safe).
- `New(d Deps) http.Handler` — builds the data-plane handler (defaults `Logger` to `slog.Default()`).
